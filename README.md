# Taskux

#### A task-taking application.
This application allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. It utilizes React for building the UI, Redux for state management, React DOM for pagination, and Tailwind CSS for styling.   
I made it just for learning Redux and understand what the library can offer.

## Technologies Used
- React
- React-Redux, React-DOM and React-Router
- UUID
- TailwindCSS

## Getting Started

To install the application, clone the repository and run the following commands: 
- npm install
- npm run dev
Once the application is running, navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser to use the application.
